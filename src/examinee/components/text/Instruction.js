        There are 9 pages and 2 questions in this exam. You must answer both
        questions one and two.
      </li>
      <li>
        Read the questions carefully and confine your responses to an analysis
        of the questions as written. Do not assume any facts not set forth in
        the questions.

      <li>
        You have two hours to complete the exam. I have given suggested times
        for each question, leaving one half hour to spare. You may allocate your
        time as you wish. I recommend that you spend some time organizing your
        thoughts before you begin to write and that you reserve some time to go
        over your responses after you have completed the exam.
